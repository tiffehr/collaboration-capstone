# Collaboration Primer

This is a public GitHub repository and [Project board](https://github.com/users/tiffehr/projects/1/views/1), which should grow to include a (Github Pages?) mini-site for my Capstone project for [CUNY Newmark J-School's 2022 Executive Program in News Innovation and Leadership](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/j-plus/executive-program/).
