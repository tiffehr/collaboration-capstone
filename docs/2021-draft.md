### Path (mid-2021 draft, unordered list)

- Initial research and literature review (was part of [SRCCON 2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pZtzizV7EGDgF2IZmNYb0VstNTDalW6SlEK9Pbwsljc/edit#heading=h.9mqudh1g77aw))
- Peer review of appendix materials
- Initial formulation and crowdsourced review
- Mini-site creation
  - Functionality will help users work through a multi-choice process
  - Localization and customization should help tailor the pitch quickly to differently sized ideas
  - Selection of pitch elements that can be fleshed out after approval, to provide an onramp to formally getting started
  - Pitch templating and generation, ready for fuller customization
- Promotional summaries of the tool and resources available, with living library of links
- User testing with advisory group and/or cycles of interested SRCCON attendees
- Public lifecycle and re-homeing?
