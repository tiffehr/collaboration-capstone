Intra-newsroom collaborations offer many advantages to newsrooms small and large.  But some of our core journalistic defensive habits â€” exclusivity, budgetary, etc. â€” need to be constructively addressed with a serious, multi-faceted pitch to stakeholders and decision makers.

This project aims to help collaborators to effectively pitch their ideas, with multi-faceted input and options.  And it introduces an organizational framework that directly appeals to making the actual pitch.

## Summary

The more we can guide decision-makers to "yes, and"-thinking and clear decision-making points, the smoother it is to gain approval to explore collaborative projects, in words, data or more.

In collaboration with peers in differently shaped newsrooms, I hope the community will maintain this project (slowly and iteratively) to help us support norms around cross-newsroom collaborations.  Supporting and augmenting norms should help focus decision-makers on _new_ facets of a project, by answering a number of considerations up front (ones that may not be traditionally expected by an editor).

Grounding the process in project-management and/or product-development thinking provides a thorough framework for building a pitch.

## [WIP] Initial Pitch-Crafting Decisions

We may expect to group types of collaborations based on planned output. But Size is perhaps a more useful grouping, because it implies different types of leadership and staffing complexity.  Size here is not meant to be strict definitions, e.g. <= 3 reporters, or 3-5 reporters, etc.

Here we're borrowing the [**relative sizing of tee-shirts**](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) that's often used by our Product or Engineering peers to guesstimate effort without getting sidetracked into definitions.  We can all understand the meaning of a shift between a Small and a Medium tee, as a projection of future effort.

A "Small" collaboration (no judgement implied!) could be as focused as 2 reporters sharing pooled resources but writing & publishing separately.  Or small reporting pods within 2 or 3 newsrooms, democratically sharing resources and co-publishing the same content on multiple news-org sites.

More complex "Small" efforts may include local news cooperative with each group lending separate expertise into a pod-style group, targeting a shared audience.  Or a reporting network, where one newsroom operates staff and resouces (the "hub"), with collaborators seen as "spokes" to the network and recipients of its work.

The third pattern in our "Small" diagram above is a sustained initaitive -- a reporting project spun out of its home news orgs into its own staffing, funding and editorial decision-making.

All of these "Small" permutations come with their own complexities and challenges once they're up and running. This is not meant to troubleshoot project configurations but instead help readers understand
