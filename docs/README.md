**This project aims to help cross-newsroom collaborators more effectively pitch their projects.**  The more we can guide decision-makers to "yes, and"-thinking and clear decision-making points, the smoother it is to gain approval to explore collaborative projects in words, data or more.

The goal is to draw from emergent industry norms to create a multi-facted pitch that front-loads many potential stumbling blocks that could arise once the project has started.  Clearly buliding on norms & patterns can help decision-makers focus on _new_ facets of a project.  The hope is this makes for faster approvals, clearer guidlines and better projects overall.

Pick and choose from a menu of options that other news organizations employ in their collaboration start-up processes, from small, helpful reminders to overarching strategic plans like like leadership structures and project sustainability.

This intentionally frames pitch-writing as a product-development step, with many metaphors and strategies borrowed from how our Product peers do their work in our news organizations.  This also helps create easier dicussions between newsroom and product groups, with shared vocabulary and frameworks to help bridge communication gaps.


## [WIP] Initial Pitch-Crafting Decisions

We may expect to group types of collaborations based on planned output. But Size is perhaps a more useful grouping, because it implies different types of leadership and staffing complexity.  Size here is not meant to be strict definitions, e.g. <= 3 reporters, or 3-5 reporters, etc.

Here we're borrowing the [**relative sizing of tee-shirts**](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) that's often used by our Product or Engineering peers to guesstimate effort without getting sidetracked into definitions.  We can all understand the meaning of a shift between a Small and a Medium tee, as a projection of future effort.

    B --> b2[\"Medium" tee/]
      b2 -->|e.g., reporting networks| md[Hub-and-spoke leadership]

A "Small" collaboration (no judgement implied!) could be as focused as 2 reporters sharing pooled resources but writing & publishing separately.  Or small reporting pods within 2 or 3 newsrooms, democratically sharing resources and co-publishing the same content on multiple news-org sites.

More complex "Small" efforts may include local news cooperative with each group lending separate expertise into a pod-style group, targeting a shared audience.  Or a reporting network, where one newsroom operates staff and resouces (the "hub"), with collaborators seen as "spokes" to the network and recipients of its work.

The third pattern in our "Small" diagram above is a sustained initaitive -- a reporting project spun out of its home news orgs into its own staffing, funding and editorial decision-making.

All of these "Small" permutations come with their own complexities and challenges once they're up and running. This is not meant to troubleshoot project configurations but instead help readers understand
