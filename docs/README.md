**This project aims to help cross-newsroom collaborators more effectively pitch their projects.**  The more we can guide decision-makers to "yes, and"-thinking and clear decision-making points, the smoother it is to jump-start your collaborative efforts.

Our goal here is to build upon news-industry norms to help us craft a multi-facted pitch that front-loads many project and process challenges, and presents them as building blocks rather than obstacles.

Transparently iterating on norms and patterns can help decision-makers focus on _new_ facets of a project.  With this forward-thinking framing, we could achieve faster approval, better guidlines and smoother projects overall.

**Pick & choose from a menu of options** employed by highly collaborative news organizations, from helpful reminders up to tactics like like leadership structures and project sustainability.

This initiative frames pitch-writing within the vocabulary of product development -- that's intentional!  What you produce may not be a "product" per se.  But we believe it is helpful to view your pitch as you asking your news org to _invest_ in one.  Your project's _process_ could be developed as a product in its own right -- a scaffold for future ideas.


## [WIP] Initial Pitch-Crafting Decisions

We may expect to group types of collaborations based on the published output. But Size is perhaps a more useful grouping, because it implies different leadership structures, staffing needs and sharing agreements.

Size here is not meant to be strict definitions, e.g. <= 3 reporters, or 3-5 reporters, etc.  We're borrowing the [**relative sizing of tee-shirts**](https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing) that's used by our Product or Engineering peers to "guesstimate" effort without getting sidetracked into definitions too early in the process.

We can all understand a shift between a Small and a Medium tee, as a projection of effort a team will have to put in.

    B --> M[\"Medium" tee/]
      M -->|Hub-and-spoke leadership| md[e.g., reporting networks]
    B --> L[\"Large" tee/]
      L -->|Dedicated leaders & staffing| lg[e.g., sustained initiatives]
</div>


A **"Small" collaboration** (no judgement implied!) could be:
- As focused as a pair of reporters sharing pooled resources but writing & publishing separately
- Reporting pods within 2 or 3 newsrooms, sharing resources and publishing the same reporting on multiple news-org sites
- Reporting pool dedicated to long-term subject-matter areas

More complex **"Medium" collaborations** may include:
- Local news cooperative, with each group lending separate expertise into a pod-style group, targeting a shared audience
- A reporting network, where one newsroom operates staff and resouces (the "hub"), with collaborators seen as "spokes" to the network and recipients of its work
- TK

**"Large" collaborations** are perhaps best exemplified by:
- "sustained initaitives" -- a reporting project spun out of its home news orgs into its own staffing, funding and editorial decision-making
- TK
- TK

All of these Size permutations come with their own complexities and challenges once they're up and running.  This initiative is not meant to provide guidance about executing on these patterns.  That is a much more challenging area of organizational analysis and strategy.


**_Sidebar:  Other Models for Collaborations_**

[**Montclair University's Center for Cooperative Media**](https://collaborativejournalism.org/models/) suggests a matrix model, with groupings by working relationships vs. time/deadlines. This [specific chart version](https://collaborativejournalism.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2019/07/TS-collaborativej-models-tip-sheet.pdf) shows their potential intersections, like "Partners work together to create content" x "One-time or finite [timelines]".  The Center breaks out a dedicated Tip Sheets which are easy to read and contain many project-planning insights.  There will be significant overlap between the Center and this initiative.

The Center for Cooporative Media's collection and Report is a fantastic resource. This particular site will point to their work pretty frequently, particularly where questions lead from crafting a pitch into executing on plans.

### "Small" Collaborations

Our tee-shirt metaphor masks a wide range of concerns even a pair of reporters may need to address over the course of their project. Below you'll find emergent norms of these kinds of projects, grouped into three areas:
1. **Audience (A)**: the people you'll be interacting with, from sources to future readers
1. **Budgeting (B)**: planning and project-management, from finances to story budgets
1. **Culture[^1] (C)**: teamwork-oriented standards, structure and staffing

[^1]: Not the best term; please suggest a better one!

The idea here is that you can **copy/paste these lists and re-mix them to fit your needs**. Delete what isn't appliable and create your own groupings.

### Applying "Types of Wins"

TK why applying the framework helps "prove" a pitch and focus your presentation into something that's crafted to approve easy stuff and maintain focus on the harder parts.
