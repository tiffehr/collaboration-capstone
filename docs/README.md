Intra-newsroom collaborations offer many advantages to newsrooms small and large.  But some of our core journalistic defensive habits â€” exclusivity, budgetary, etc. â€” need to be constructively addressed with a serious, multi-faceted pitch to stakeholders and decision makers.

This project aims to help collaborators to effectively pitch their ideas, with multi-faceted input and options.  And it introduces an organizational framework that directly appeals to making the actual pitch.

## Summary

The more we can guide decision-makers to "yes, and"-thinking and clear decision-making points, the smoother it is to gain approval to explore collaborative projects, in words, data or more.

In collaboration with peers in differently shaped newsrooms, I hope the community will maintain this project (slowly and iteratively) to help us support norms around cross-newsroom collaborations.  Supporting and augmenting norms should help focus decision-makers on _new_ facets of a project, by answering a number of considerations up front (ones that may not be traditionally expected by an editor).

Grounding the process in project-management and/or product-development thinking provides a thorough framework for building a pitch.
