# Types of Wins

## Intro to the Framework

## Insight Wins
> * Knowledge collected and shared for all project stages
> * Quick answers (wins) as well as new areas for exploration
> * (these are things that decision-makers should agree are valuable and therefore they're bought in to them)

## Process Wins
> * Assessed resources (available and still needed)
> * Early explorations (pilots), live and generating information
> * Things that accerate the pace of progress overall

## Capability Wins
> * Assessed resources already in use and succeeding
> * Established (and document) workflows
> * Delivering quality output in a sustainable way

## Outcome Wins
> * Growth for target metrics, e.g. audience analytics or publishing reach
> * One or more advantages secured, based on the collaboration's goals
> * New channels established and generating dividends (can be non-monetary!)
> * Real lessons observed and _learned_ that shape the next effort

## Impact Wins
> * External responses and change TK
> * Internal responses and change TK

## For This Initiative

## Insight Wins
* Surface a broader spectrum of collaboration types than may occur to a team or group
* Collaborations can provide skill-building and growth opportunities that help with retention
* Clear assessment of tensions between collaborations and culture of exclusivity
* Streamlining decision-making for or against collaborations can have high standards and other Wins baked in from the start
* TK

## Process Wins
* Shared resources and costs help ease decision-making and maintenance burdens
* A strong template for collaboration decision-making can be automatically inclusive of multiple roles
* Competitively-driven patterns and norms help "float all boats"
* This "Types of Wins" framework itself is pretty helpful
* TK


## Capability Wins
* Skill-building, for all sides of the collaboration in cross-organization work 
* Product-oriented thinking, either an introduction or reaffirmation
* Connections and networking, within beats
* Socializing multi-faceted aspects of collaborative agreements, particularly those targeting sourcing and trust between journalism and audience
* TK 

## Outcome Wins
* Use!
* Community-driven evolution and improvement
* Resonance for organizations that are strongly collaboration-focused
* Helpful for organizations with minimal collaborative habits, in "upping their game"
* Library deeper into available resources, communities and organizational patterns

## Impact Wins
* Raising the bar for speed and nuance in collaborative decisions
* Widen community participation, both journalist and prospective audience members
* Shared and resonance examples
