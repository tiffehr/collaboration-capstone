# Types of Wins

Successful pitches work best when you get decision-makers on your side for many elements, before asking them to focus on where a new collaboration may stretch previous boundaries. Many communication frameworks can apply here, but my recommended framework is referred to as Types of Wins. (It's also how I worked to refine this project, itself!)

## So what are the Types?

Here are descriptions of what each grouping of Wins can mean.  And they fit a progression, as well:

### Insight Wins
> * Knowledge collected and shared for all collaboration stages
> * Quick answers (wins) as well as new areas for exploration
> * (these are things that decision-makers should agree are valuable and therefore they're bought in to them)

### Process Wins
> * Assessed resources (available and still needed)
> * Early explorations (pilots), live and generating information
> * Things that accerate the pace of progress overall

### Capability Wins
> * Assessed resources already in use and succeeding
> * Established (and document) workflows
> * Delivering quality output in a sustainable way

### Outcome Wins
> * Growth for target metrics, e.g. audience analytics or publishing reach
> * One or more advantages secured, based on a collaboration's goals
> * New channels established and generating dividends (can be non-monetary!)
> * Real lessons observed and _learned_ that shape the next effort

### Impact Wins
> * External responses and change TK
> * Internal responses and change TK
