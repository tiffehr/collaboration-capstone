# Refining Your Pitch with "Types of Wins"

Successful pitches work best when you get decision-makers on your side for many elements, before you even ask them to expand their mental models.

Many communication frameworks can apply here, but our recommended framework is "Types of Wins". (It's also how I worked to refine this initiative!)

## So what are the Types?

Here are descriptions of what each grouping of Wins can mean.  They are a progression!

For each group, the first bullet describes the Win we're thinking about, with a very narrow focus.

The second bullet in parentheses is the thought process you want to _trigger_ in your audience, which can be particularly powerful within pitches.

### Insight Wins
* Experience and expertise to be gained by all collaborators, or quick-turn explorations than can guide your next steps
* _(things that decision-makers should immediately understand and buy into, e.g., “yes, and…”)_

### Process Wins
* _New_ resources to request and try or pilot; see if they fit and what insights they can provide[^protip]
* _(adopting tools & tactics that could accelerate this or many projects)_

[^protip]: many things on our main Checklists may be Process Wins, if adopting some of those MOUs or Joint Agreements or Planning Documents are new to your organization

### Capability Wins
* How _existing_ resources & workflows can be brought to bear, and what iteration is needed; skill-building that helps with staff development & engagement
* _(building habits that help us deliver sustainable, high-quality work)_

### Outcome Wins
* Advantages and gains “secured”, lessons learned and things that help provide a measurable result
* _(real examples & lessons that can shape the next project, or failures that provide constructive examples)_

### Impact Wins _(an addition for journalistic projects)_
* Audience response, internal response, growth in the ambition with which we pick projects
* _(the expected response to publishing, separated from the Outcome Wins for project execution)_


## Where to Start?

Here are some suggested steps:

1. **Start with the one you think will be easiest to address** -- Impact or Outcome or Capabilities
  * But as you work on a bullet or two for each, _really_ think about the underlying Win.  Is it really a Capability shared by all collaborators?  Or is it really a Process improvement, with a bit less about the people and more about the new [whatever]?
  * You may find yourself moving some around, or seeing some duplication & overlap. That's good!
  * There's no rule about having entries for each
  * Also no rule about having a lot for one and few for another
  * It may also reveal a lot abou your own focus areas, and places you aren't yet comfortable analyzing
1. Once you have at minimum one bullet per Win, **try to focus on what _else_ could be in that group**, if you were tasked with just that Win
  * Here's where the parentheses may help you think about it from a decision-maker's perspective
  * If you believe using Tool X will be a net gain for the staff, what pushback might you encounter?
  * Can you pre-load your reasons?
  * How concise can you make that explanation, and can it build on a past project's success/challenges?

In your pitch, you may **not** want to list your "Types of Wins" work directly.  Particularly if your colleagues have a strong eye-roll reflex to "jargon".

It may work best as a way for you to _organize_ what you'd like to say, as if you had uninterrupted time (ha).

Perhaps start with talking about Outcomes & Impact, which should catch the ear of even the most day-dreaming colleague. _Then_ shift to talk about Capability wins.

Insight Wins may be the toughest to identify, without really seeing things through boss-level eyes.  It may be fine to leave that one unexplored, for this specific pitch/project.

All bosses are different, so this leads towards tailoring for their habitual questions if you happen to know them.  If not, this is a good mechanism to start finding that out!  Perhaps their questions are all about Outcomes rather than Capabilities.  Or about Process but not Insights -- that's helpful to know, too, if you're a Product or bridge role person.
